# The Speaking Egg

Kyle Booten + Orr Menirom (Clear All)

An egg that speaks poetry if you give it words.

An egg that learns to speak if you teach it.

An egg that tells you how to teach it. 

An algorithm that is only as good as your training, your care.  

***

Words fed to the bot are repurposed into the bot's utterances.  Positive and negative feedback trains a classifier that in turn determines how the bot speaks.

The bot sometimes asks questions about what it has said.
